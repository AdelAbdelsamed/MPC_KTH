# Model Predictive Control - EL2700 (Autumn 2023)

Repository for the Model Predictive Control (MPC) coursework. This repository contains the code and resources for the course assignments and the final project work for the EL2700 course at KTH in the autumn term of 2023.

## Course Overview

This coursework consists of four homework assignments and a comprehensive project work. The homework progressively builds control design tasks and simulation, all centered around NASA's Astrobee robot.

### Homework Assignments

1. **Homework 1 - Discrete-Time Linear Control**
   - Pole placement using Linear State Feedback.

2. **Homework 2 - Finite-Time Optimal Control**
   - Utilizing the Casadi software for finite-time optimal control of Astrobee's trajectory.
     
3. **Homework 3 - Linear-Quadratic Regulator**
   - Exploring linear-quadratic control design with reference tracking for the Astrobee robot.

4. **Homework 4 - Model Predictive Control**
   - Focusing on Linear Model Predictive Control techniques.

### Project Work

In addition to the homework assignments, the project work entails:

- **Nonlinear MPC for Astrobee Rendezvous**
  - Exploring a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) approach for the trajectroy planning of the Astrobee Rendezvous.
  - Evaluating the performance of the NMPC in simulations.
